# GuessingGame
A mini game
So i basically just learned how  to create mobile applications using xamarin forms and this is my firt mobile app. 
I create a mini game that allows player to guess a number until they can guess what random number the game has selected. 
The game will let the player know when they have made a selection that is higher or lower than the correct number.
it will also let the player know when they have guessed the correct number.
Enjoy and please give your feedback kindly to this newbie!
